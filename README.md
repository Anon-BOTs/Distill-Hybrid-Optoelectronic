## Introduction

ðŸ’¥PHOENIX presented the first optoelectrically fused neural network deployment framework for object detection tasks, demonstrating its performance in industrial-level large datasets (e.g., COCO) and benchmark models. 
Compared to state-of-the-art electronic models, our solution achieved approximately 85.0% accuracy. The accuracy was further improved to 93.0% through our novel knowledge distillation strategy. 
Furthermore, we achieved 86.5% energy reduction and 11.3Ã— speed acceleration compared to equivalent edge GPUs by successfully transferring spatial attention knowledge from the electronic domain to the photonic domain, 
making it an ideal choice for real-time, energy-critical industrial applications. This technique not only bridges the performance gap but also offers an alternative physically interpretable platform for AI. Our universal framework paves the way for extending ONN deployment to a wider range of deep learning models and applications, whether based on CNN or Transformer architectures, providing a compelling choice for real-time, energy-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving, smart surveillance, and industrial automation.ðŸ’¥

## Overview
ðŸ’¥ Overview of the proposed hybrid photoelectronic object detection framework, ***PHOENIX***.
The system is built upon a state-of-the-art baseline detector, where early-stage extracts low/mid-level
features by the CNN-based or Transformer-based method. The key component of the knowledge
distillation module transfers all-electronic â€™teacherâ€™ backbone to the ONN â€™studentâ€™ stages, enhancing
their functional capabilities. Finally, features output by the ONN-processed segment of the backbone
are fed to a task-specific detection head for object classification and localization.
